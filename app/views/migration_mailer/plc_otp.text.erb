PLC VERIFICATION CODE
Migration <%= @migration.token %>

CRITICAL: Point of No Return
============================

Hello,

Your migration is ready for the final, IRREVERSIBLE step. You're about to submit your PLC token to redirect your DID to the new PDS.

YOUR VERIFICATION CODE:

    <%= @otp %>

Expires in: <%= @expires_in %>


🚨 THIS IS THE POINT OF NO RETURN

Once you submit this code along with your PLC token, your account will be permanently migrated to the new PDS.

- Your DID will point to the new PDS immediately
- You cannot undo this operation
- Make sure your new account is ready before proceeding


How to Use This Code:

1. Go to your migration status page:
   <%= @migration_url %>

2. Enter your PLC token (from your old PDS email)

3. Enter this verification code: <%= @otp %>

4. Submit both to complete the migration

Note: You have 5 attempts to enter the correct code. After that, you'll need to request a new one.

Migration Token: <%= @migration.token %>

If you didn't request this code, someone may be attempting to access your migration.
