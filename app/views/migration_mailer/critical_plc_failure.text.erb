🚨 CRITICAL MIGRATION FAILURE - URGENT ACTION REQUIRED 🚨
==============================================================

Your AT Protocol account migration has encountered a CRITICAL ERROR
during the PLC directory update (Point of No Return).

⚠️ YOUR ACCOUNT MAY BE IN AN UNCERTAIN STATE ⚠️


🚨 IMPORTANT - DO NOT:
=======================

❌ Start a new migration
❌ Delete this email
❌ Attempt manual recovery without support
❌ Change your account settings on either PDS

Your account data is safe, but the PLC directory state needs to be
verified by our support team before you take any action.


WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:
=====================

1. Save this email - You will need the information below

2. Save your migration token:

<% if @rotation_key.present? %>
3. Save your rotation key (account recovery mechanism):
   <%= @rotation_key %>

   ⚠️ This is your only way to revert PLC changes if needed!
   Store it in a secure location (password manager, encrypted file)
<% end %>

4. Contact support IMMEDIATELY:
   <%= @support_email %>

5. Include this migration token in your support request:
   <%= @migration.token %>
