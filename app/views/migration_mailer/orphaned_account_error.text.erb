⚠️ MIGRATION ISSUE - ORPHANED ACCOUNT FOUND
==========================================

Migration Token: <%= @migration.token %>

Hello,

Your migration from <%= @migration.old_handle %> to <%= @migration.new_pds_host %> encountered an issue.


🚫 WHAT HAPPENED
----------------
An account with your DID (<%= @migration.did %>) already exists on the target PDS <%= @migration.new_pds_host %>.

This orphaned account is likely from a previous failed migration attempt and must be removed before your migration can proceed.


📋 WHAT THIS MEANS
------------------
• Your migration has been PAUSED (not failed permanently)
• No data has been lost or damaged
• The target PDS provider needs to remove the orphaned account
• Once removed, you can retry your migration


📧 NEXT STEPS: CONTACT PDS PROVIDER
------------------------------------
Please contact the support team for <%= @migration.new_pds_host %> to request removal of the orphaned account:

Email: <%= @target_pds_support_email %>

Include in your message:
• Migration Token: <%= @migration.token %>
• DID: <%= @migration.did %>


⏳ AFTER SUPPORT RESPONDS
--------------------------
Once the orphaned account has been removed:
1. Return to your migration status page: <%= @migration_url %>
2. Click the "Retry Migration" button
3. Your migration will resume automatically
